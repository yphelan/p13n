## Content Understanding
Content understanding in the context of Recommender Systems refers to the process of extracting and interpreting meaningful data from the content itself, which is then used to inform the recommendations. This is an essential part of building effective recommendation algorithms that can provide relevant, personalized content for users. Here are a few practical questions to ask about your content:

**Question: What features and characteristics can we use to best describe and group content?** Can these groupings form a natural hierarchy? For example, movies can be grouped by genres (_Drama_) and subgenres (_Medical Drama, Political Drama_). Content topology of this nature is important when the system needs to present content which is either similar, or distinct from what the user has already been exposed to.  

**Question: What is the smallest unit of content and is it uniquely identifiable within the system**. While this is an obvious question, it is important that we understand and uniquely identify the different variations of a piece of content. For example, in an e-commerce platform, the smallest unit of content is the SKU, which represents the product (_LuxeBrand Sectional_) + it's features (_Beige, L-Shaped Right_)


**Question: How is content quality defined?** The adage "garbage in, garbage out" is especially true in Recommender Systems. Quickly identifying low-quality content and down-ranking or outright filtering them out of the system goes a long way in building and maintaining user trust in recommended content.

**Question: Is there content that should not be recommeded for legal or ethical reasons?** Similar to the previous question, it is important to define within the system what types of content are illegal or unethical to recommend. A human-in-the-loop team dedicated to Trust and Safety is an important component of a Recommender System. Set this team up early, otherwise be ready for the ensuing user churn and possible lawsuits.

**Question: What contexts, surfaces or channels should we avoid applying personalization techniques?** For example, while I appreciate and probably expect personalization in Spotify-owned playlists, I certainly do not want Spotify re-ranking my private, carefully curated playlists, and if they do, it should be an opt-in experience.

**Question: Is there a seasonality dimension to content?** If so, ensure to capture seasonality attributes on your content. For example, christmas related content should be tagged as such within the system. There's only a shortlist of things more annoying than receiving personalized emails from your favorite shopping site for christmas deals in February of the following year -_-.
